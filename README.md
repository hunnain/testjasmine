## Current Objective and Key Results
**Objective:**
1. Just drag and drop the files from your local hard disk, and the Glasswall Desktop will rebuild them using the Glasswall Rebuild API (currently hosted on Azure).
2. To support different directory structures, give freedom to save the files at custom directory structure or at default location by maintaining the same directory as that of the parent folder.
3. To support different platforms (Windows, MAC and Linux)
